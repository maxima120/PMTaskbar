Poor Man (Vertical) Taskbar for Windows 11

Quick solution for those who needs vertical taskbar for Windows 11. I hope Microsoft adds native solution but for now - use this one.

It can only open .lnk links for now

Add a link to your desktop, then drag-drop it into PMT window. It will be saved so next time you get the same position, size and set of links.

Right click on a link to unpin it.

Use your favourite method to run this on logon - Startup Menu, Task Scheduler, registry..

Close this by right-click on the actual Windows 11 taksbar and "Close all windows"

*Note: it is a quick solution, has not been tested with different monitors / DPI settings.*
